# Auswendig
Licence: Copyright (C) April 2020, Marius Evans, All Rights Reserved.<br />
AuswendigLite has been released, download the .zip file on the releases tab. <br />
A new version Auswendig (GUI) will be released soon.

## Introduction
Auswendig is flexible memorisation software written in Java. It is inspired by Quizlet and Anki. 
Auswendig offers multiple activities for a deck of flashcards:
1. Study regular cards (either shuffled, reversed, or normal order)<br/>
2. Star important cards and study them only (either shuffled, reversed order, or normal order)<br/>
3. Study cards that contain a specific tag, for example: "german" (either shuffled, reversed or normal order)<br/>
4. Do a writing activity - write the definition for a random card shown<br/>
5. Do a multiple choice quiz - pick the correct definition for a card<br/>

## Versions of Auswendig

### AuswendigLite (command-line)
Do all of this in the command-line! This is a performance-friendly version of Auswendig that runs directly in the command-line and still offers the functionality expected.

### Auswendig (GUI)
A new version of Auswendig (GUI) will be released soon, the previous release has been removed so that it could be rebuilt from the ground up to be more efficient, useable and less bugy.

## Why Auswendig and not Quizlet, Anki or Memorise?
1. Auswendig is free, can be accessed offline and has greater ease of use than Quizlet;
2. The write activity enables a user to write the definition of a term for a card.<br />
3. Auswendig features a multiple choice activity, unlike Anki.<br />
4. Auswendig features more activites than Anki.<br />
5. Unlike with Anki, you can star the most important cards to you and read them in order, shuffled or in reverse order.<br />
6. You can study flashcards that contain any specific tag you entered.<br />
7. You can export your deck of flashcards so you can print them!<br />
8. AuswendigLite is completely performance-friendly.<br />
