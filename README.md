# Auswendig
Auswendig is flexible flashcard software written in Java, it is similar to Quizlet and Anki.<br />
You can go to the releases tab now and download either a lite (command-line) or GUI version of Auwendig.<br />
Auswendig offers multiple activities for a deck of flashcards:
1. Study regular cards (either shuffled, reversed, or normal order)<br/>
2. Star important cards and study them only (either shuffled, reversed order, or normal order)<br/>
3. Study cards that contain a specific tag, for example: "german" (either shuffled, reversed or normal order)<br/>
4. Do a writing activity - write the definition for a random card shown<br/>
5. Do a multiple choice quiz - pick the correct definition for a card<br/>

## Versions of Auswendig

### Auswendig (GUI)
This is Auswendig with a graphical user interface, this makes it very easy to use and understand and packs incredible functionality.

### AuswendigLite (command-line)
Do all of this in the command-line! This is a performance-friendly version of Auswendig that runs directly in the command-line and still offers the functionality expected.

## Why Auswendig and not Quizlet, Anki or Memorise?
1. Auswendig is free, can be accessed offline and has greater ease of use than Quizlet;
2. The write activity enables a user to write the definition of a term for a card.<br />
3. Auswendig features a multiple choice activity, unlike Anki.<br />
4. Auswendig features more activites than Anki.<br />
5. Unlike with Anki, you can star the most important cards to you and read them in order, shuffled or in reverse order.<br />
6. You can study flashcards that contain any specific tag you entered.<br />
7. You can export your deck of flashcards so you can print them!<br />
8. AuswendigLite is completely performance-friendly.<br />
9. Auswendig (GUI) allows you to show or hide the definition of a card and swap the term and definition for a card around.<br />
